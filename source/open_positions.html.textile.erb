h3. CSTV12 - Software development for emerging markets

Emerging software development methodologies, such as participated design (e.g., Living Labs), component-based software development (e.g., RubyOnRails), and agile development (e.g., SCRUM), allow teams to build solutions which are fit to the needs of users, while reducing time to market and overall production costs. This is particularly important emerging and mature economies alike, since user-adoption and time-to-market are two main goals, which can make the difference between failure and success. The trade-off is that the code tends to grow disorderly and without a reference architecture. The issue is particularly evident with web applications, which are so often based on one or more (scripting) language to manage the business logic (e.g., Ruby, PHP, Python, Java) and Javascript for the front-end interaction. As interaction with users and agile sprints help the team deliver value to the customer, the code base tends to grow disorderly, data structures are replicated in different layers, and maintenance can become a serious issue. The grant has the goal of investigating and improving current practices and tools to build software products for emerging markets, while taking into account other non-functional constraints, such as maintainability.

h3. CSTV21 - Socio-technical and Gamified Systems for managing Health and Wellbeing (co-funded by TrentoRISE, FBK and CRG)

According to the WHO (World Health Organization), various health risk factors are related to life-style and dietary habits and the number of pathologies due to bad dietary habits are growing both in developed and in developing countries.

The purpose of this scholarship is to develop innovative methods and techniques to enhance awareness about one's personal dietary habits and educating towards behaviors which are more adherent to national and international guidelines. More in details, we intend to experiment gamification techniques to build and experiment systems which allow to enable forms of quantified-self (systematic data gathering on life habits related to nutrition) and peer-pressure (pressure by peers to change behaviors). The goals of the scholarship include conceptual design, prototype implementation, and experimentations to verify the effectiveness of such systems, with the ultimate goal of understanding what techniques are more effective in inducing changes.

The activity is characterized by research in social innovation with a great potential industrial impact. We After a preliminary analysis to evaluate the state of the art, one or more prototypes will be developed to verify their impact and effectiveness. Data gathering (respecting personal privacy rights) will then allow the candidate to quantitatively evaluate the hypotheses initially formulated, and the selection of the most promising solutions. Activities will be planned following SCRUM monthly sprints to guarantee strategic guidance and the flexibility required by this kind of activity.

The ideal candidate has a strong propension to innovation, excellent research and programming skills. The candidate will work in CRG ("Centro Ricerche GPI":http://www.cr-gpi.it), and in the ICT4G group, in an international and innovative environment, providing access to excellent facilities and resources.
