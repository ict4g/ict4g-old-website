Our chapter entitled "A Synthesis of Vote Verification Methods in Electronic Voting Systems" has been published!

*Abstract*  A large number of researches have been conducted to improve public verifiability of e-voting systems. One of the challenges is ensuring that different and apparently contradicting requirements are met: anonymity and representation, vote secrecy and verifiability. System robustness from attacks adds further complexity. This chapter summarizes some of the known vote verification techniques and highlights the pros and cons of each technique. Also, it reviews how different verification technologies cover different phases of the voting process and evaluates how these techniques satisfy the e-voting requirements.
