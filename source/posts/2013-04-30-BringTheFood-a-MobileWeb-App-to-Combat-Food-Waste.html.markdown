Food Donors (e.g., restaurants, event organizers and individual households) and Food Collectors (e.g. charity organizations) have bottlenecks in sharing crucial information, such as where and when food is available, when and from where to pick up the food, whom to contact to be a potential Food Donor or Collector, and efficient ways of collecting food to reduce costs (e.g. fuel cost). Bring The Food (BTF) is an extensible, open-source mobile/web App to provide such services with the aim of combating food wastage.

The new version of BTF is now available for testing <a href="http://www.bringfood.org">here</a>! It is an alpha release, so expect it to be buggy. We invite you to play with it and let us know of any bug you encounter or of any suggestion to improve the application.
