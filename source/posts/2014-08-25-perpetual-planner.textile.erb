We are starting planning activities for next year and we built a "perpetual" planner, which we instantiated for the following 15 months (Sep 2014 -- Dec 2015).

The "compulsory" screenshot:

It is a LibreOffice spreadsheet, which can be downloaded here: "PerpetualPlanner.ods":<% aurl "images/posts/2014-08-25/PerpetualPlanner.ods" %>. Notice that there are no formulas to compute the days: this could be a nice extension, if you feel to do so!
