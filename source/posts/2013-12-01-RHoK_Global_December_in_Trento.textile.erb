Please join us on December 7-8, 2013 for a RHoK Global hackathon in Trento!
 
Throughout the weekend, we will be coding around problems related to ICT for development in areas such as food waste, social accountability, and fighting corruption.
 
RHoK has been working with subject matter experts around the world to develop problem statements addressing global issues. These problem statements will be the hacking challenges thrown out to the developers at the RHoK hackathon. See those statements as they develop at "http://www.rhok.org":http://www.rhok.org At the end of the weekend, we’ll invite you to share your RHoK application with the group with the potential to win prizes and see your work put to use on the ground to save lives and alleviate suffering.
