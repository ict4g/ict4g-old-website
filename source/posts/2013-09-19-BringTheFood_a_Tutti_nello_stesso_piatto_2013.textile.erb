FOOD SAVERS (ESSENSRETTER) is the story of people who are fighting for a different approach to one of lifeâ€™s essentials. Farmers, supermarket executives, cooks, design students and completely average households, each one is at a different point in the supply, production and consumption chain. What they all share is the desire to bring about a new appreciation of food, replacing the one that, bit by bit, has been lost in recent years.
