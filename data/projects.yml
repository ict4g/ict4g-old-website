      The main goal of this project is reducing food waste
      in school canteens by measuring how much food each student leaves on the
      tray at every meal and by generating awareness on food waste among the students.

      The Hour of Code is a global movement reaching over 100 million students in more than 180 countries.
      It started as a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify "code", to show that anybody can learn the basics, and to broaden participation in the field of computer science. It has since become a worldwide effort to celebrate computer science, starting with 1-hour coding activities but expanding to all sorts of community efforts.

    <p>The goal had the goal of defining an interoperability framework for the e-Government systems
    of Mozambique and defining an implementation plan to carry out the
    transition.  The definition of the framework
    presented some interesting challenges due to the need of taking into account
    some specific requirements typical of a fast-growing, developing country,
    among which we mention:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>The centralized, top-down approach typically associated to any
    interoperability framework had to be reconciled with the fast,
    decentralized, and loosely controlled development of IT solutions going on
    in Mozambique

    <li>the standardization process, typically comprising the different
    technical layers to guarantee proper interoperability of the IT systems,
    had to be "lifted" at the software management and development level, to
    simplify longer-term maintainability of the IT solutions integration of
    manual and automated processes had to be taken into account the framework
    had to be scalable and flexible in order to make its adoption sustainable
    in the longer term.</li>

    <p>Law-makers, designers of legal information systems and citizens
    are often challenged by the complexity of bodies of laws and the
    growing number of references needed to interpret a law.
    This line of activities investigates ways in which laws can be
    presented to citizens and law makers as to improve comprehension
    and fruibility.</p>
  description: >-
    Taking inspiration from various techniques developed for software
    development, such as requirement and quality management, in this project we
    investigated different approaches to present laws in formats which could
    make them simpler to understand.

    The work stemmed into three main branches:

    <ul class="disc">
      <li><b>Semantic annotation of laws.</b> The goal of the activity is the definition of
      a markup to identify semantically rich concepts in the wording of laws.</li>
      <li><b>Procedural Laws and Processes</b> Various laws, such as the electoral law, describe
      the way in which certain processes have to be executed.  Presenting such laws using
      notations that are best suited to represent processes, such as BPMN, can improve the
      way in which laws are interpreted and understood.  This line of activity investigated
      how the Italian electoral law could be represented as a set of activity diagrams and
      presented by different mediums, such as an interactive website</li>
      <li><b>Traceability between Laws and Processes</b> Building upon the previous
      work, we also extended a UML modeling tool to allow modellers to mantain
      traceability between laws and the process (steps) they represent.  This
      simplifies the manteinance process of laws in case procedures need to be
      revised. The tool was applied to manage the evolution of electoral laws to
      allow for an experimentation of electronic voting systems.</li>
      <li><b>(Quantitative) Analysis of Laws</b> In many countries reading laws
      can be a daunting task.  This is not only due to the wording or the way in
      which some laws are written, but also to the many changes law undergo in their
      lifecycle and to the many cross-references that need to be analyzed to get
      a complete picture.  In many ways, such dependencies in legal documents
      resemble those which can be found in source code files when developing
      software.  Quality metrics have been defined in software development to
      analyze how difficult it is to mantain source code.  In this line of
      activity we analyzed the Italian body of laws applying metrics to measure their
      complexity and using visualization tools to simplify the browsing of laws.

    <p>Empowering citizens in making Governments more accountable and
    transparent in the services they provide has gained more attention
    in the last few years both in the developing and in the developed
    world. At the basis of any such exercise, information and data
    collection activities play an important role.</p>

    <p>SAMO stands for "Social Accountability in Mozambique" and the project,
    conducted in collaboration with the Ministry of
    Education of Mozambique, the World Bank and the Maputo Living Lab had the goal of
    collecting data about various procurement indicators of primary
    schools in the Moamba district, a rural area of Mozambique.</p>

    <p>For this purpose
    we developed a data collection platform and a mobile application to conduct field work
    and collected 677 interviews.</p>
  description:
    <p>Citizen involvement is critical for enhancing democratic
    governance, improving service delivery, and fostering empowerment.
    For these reasons many actors, among which the World Bank have
    started or are starting initiatives to empower citizens in making
    their Governments more accountable and transparent.</p>

    <p>Such empowerment, however, can be exercised if an adequate
    level of awareness and know-how are shared with and by the
    citizens.  This includes not only information about a specific
    situation or the current status of things in a specific sector
    (like, e.g., the status of schools in a rural area), but also
    know-how about the chain of responsibility and accountability.</p>

    <p>In the project we developed an application based on a RoR
    server and on an Android client.  In June 2012 we conducted in the
    region of Moamba (Mozambique) in June 2012 about primary schools in
    the region. The pilot, sponsored by the World Bank and aided by a
    platform -- called SAMo, Social Accountability for Mozambique -- we
    developed for the project, involved 677 citizens who commented on
    various procurement indicators meant to measure the efficacy of
    specific interventions in the region. Our contribution includes an
    updated report on the status of various schools in the region, some
    technical consideration about platforms for crowdsourcing data, and
    some initial steps to better understand the process of social
    accountability.</p>
