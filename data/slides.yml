  venue: Sala Stringa, FBK
  description: |
    The profile of South Africans online is changing as
    internet-enabled smart phones and feature phones become ubiquitous
    in low-income communities. However, poorer users are using a
    different internet, a prepaid internet trickle where text is
    dominant and where most people only briefly enter “the cloud” of
    content sharing. This means that app developers and designers need
    to re-imagine a world beyond the binaries of access or non-access
    where internet use can mean multiple things. This seminar explores
    how unemployed young people from the low-income black
    neighbourhoods of Grahamstown, a small town in South Africa, use
    ICT under very difficult economic circumstances. In these digital
    ecologies, PCs are peripheral, and digital production and
    connectivity revolves around the mobile. Media sharing happens
    predominantly offline via Bluetooth, but also now on online
    platforms that allows users to only download what they want - such
    as media sharing WAP sites on Russian platforms. Social networks
    such as WhatsApp and Facebook mobile are also becoming
    increasingly important.  Creative expression is very important for
    these young people and is seen as essential for developing the
    community – here development is not only seen in material
    terms. Young people use mobile phones and computers for a variety
    of creative activities and Facebook plays a key part in sharing
    these. Using a PC becomes a challenge when all internet access is
    negotiated through the mobile, and PCs are a makeshift assembly of
    old parts put together in backroom computer ‘workshops’ by
    self-taught technicians. The author, although not a designer or
    computer scientist herself, is keen to explore design
    considerations and welcomes interaction on what these practices
    could mean for ICT4D design. How do we design for those
    intermittently on the mobile internet but outside “the cloud”, for
    example? How do we design for second-hand communal PC users who
    are part of the mobile-first generation and exclusively use the
    mobile internet? When mobile phones are designed primarily for
    content consumption – in a space where there are few PCs and many
    people who want to create content – how can we design apps to make
    them more suited to digital production? The author will share some
    examples from the UCT (University of Cape Town) ICT4D lab, where
    designers have focused on Bluetooth technology to respond to
    limited internet access.

    The implementation of Information and Communication Technologies
    in developmental contexts presents specific social and technical
    challenges. Understanding the lessons learned and documenting best
    practices under extreme conditions, such as the ones found on the
    African continent, can provide valuable insights for ICT
    deployment in developing countries. At the same time, the
    experience in use cases and technical know-how of developed
    countries can help regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa in
    harnessing the full potential of ICT for social and economic
    development. This paper describes the preliminary results of an
    international project based on the exchange between two European
    institutes and two South African universities, whose goal is to
    define a set of best practices to improve the success rate of ICT
    for Development projects. This led to the definition of a Maturity
    Model to evaluate performing organizations with respect to what
    characterises a successful ICTD project to guide them in the
    improvement of their processes towards becoming more effective in
    addressing the needs of rural communities. The practices and
    maturity goals included in the maturity model have been collected
    through an extensive literature review and interviews with project
    managers.

    This study analyzes various food databases of different nations

    step will guide us to analyze the data in each databank and avoid
    redundancy in the data, hence create a consistent set of data
    table.
