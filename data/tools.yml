    <p>A significant amount of food is wasted everyday by restaurants,
    caterers, supermarkets, etc. Nevertheless, people in need seek
    help from organizations collecting and distributing unused but
    still edible food. Such organizations mostly rely on agreements
    with regular donors. Access to information about food availability
    and occasional donors is limited and not systematic, creating
    logistic bottlenecks.</p>

    <p>"BringTheFood" is a crowdsourcing web/mobile application that
    allows donors to seamlessly publish offers and easily coordinate
    collections. Collectors can view the offers in their area on a map
    and reserve those that are available and schedule pickup directly
    with the donor.</p>

    <p>Reducing waste and improve recyclable waste collection are two
    important goals of every waste-management agency. However, the
    involvement of citizens and their capability to make a different
    is often limited, due to several factors, among which the
    difficulty in perceiving that a change in behavior can make a
    difference and the difficulty in getting real-time feedback about
    cases which are difficult to classify.</p>

    <p>The main goal of ComeButta is helping citizens in determining the
    correct way to dispose of garbage.  The approach reverses the
    "standard" information flow: rather than having citizens consult
    long lists of examples, ComeButta allows citizens to ask
    questions, which are answered by an automatic classifier trained
    on previous cases submitted by experts and citizens.</p>

    <p>An important aspect of any procurement activity is guaranteeing
    that contracted work gets delivered on time and within budget. For
    some contractors, rushing to achieve the previous two goals (or to
    increase margins) sometimes comes at the expenses of the quality
    of the delivered product (e.g. unfinished or low quality
    work).</p>

    <p>Since citizens are the ultimate beneficiaries of the policies
    intervention of donors, empowering them in supporting quality
    inspection and quality assurance activities of procurement
    activities can help achieve two significant goals:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>close the loop</b> in various procurement activities, by
          having the beneficiaries systematically collect information
          about the quality of delivered results;
      </li>
      <li><b>move the responsibility of monitoring service delivery where
          it belongs, namely with citizens</b>; in the process help
          making citizens more aware of their role in making their
          Governments accountable for effective implementations and
          delivery of services.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>SAMO is a web platform to crowdsource procurement indicators,
    which we have experimented, in collaboration with the WorldBank
    and the Ministry of Education of the Government of Mozambique in
    the Moamba region.</p>

    <p>According to MIPAAF, mountain agriculture is a sector worth 30
    billion euros which involves more than 2.5 million farms (280.000
    of which are Italian). Geographical location and size, however,
    make it difficult for such farms to be self-sustainable and many
    of them rely on subsidies and other public funds.</p>

    <p>In fact, a report of ATABio (an Association of producers of
    bio-food in Trentino) specifies that increasing promotion and
    commercialization of products is one of the main areas of
    improvement for producers of bio-food in Trentino.

    <p>GasAPP is a fork of BringTheFood focusing on bio-food,
    sustaining local buyers groups and producers of high-quality
    products. The platform matches demand and offer.</p>

      A web/mobile app for restaurants and canteen to notify food collectors about daily 
      surplus. The food collectors see how many meals they can take so they optimise the logistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app is in a pilot stage and it is currently experimented by three school canteens in Trentino
      and the <em>SitiCibo</em> initiative of the Italian Food Bank.
