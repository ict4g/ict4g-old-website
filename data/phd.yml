  title: "OVVM: Open Vote Verification Technique for DRE Systems"
  period: 2011-2015
  institution: University of Bolzano
  abstract: >-
    For the last two decades, researchers in e-voting have been looking for
    solutions that could facilitate the election process. These efforts led to
    different e-voting systems implementations, among which we mention the
    optical scan systems, the Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) system, and
    the Online (Internet) voting systems. In parallel with the use of e-voting
    systems, many questions emerge. One of these questions is how to allow
    voters or any third party to verify votes are correctly captured, stored,
    and counted. This underlines the fact that an e-voting system is not only
    required for ensuring its technical and procedural security, but must also
    provide mechanisms by which voters verify their votes during and after
    casting, and other observer verify the correctness and integrity of
    election results. To facilitate the vote verification process, a number of
    verification techniques (either physical or digital) have been
    developed. However, I observed that these techniques have a number of
    limitations. Also, they are not based on interoperable components and
    processes, and lock the use to a specific technology (vendor lock-in). In
    order to address these issues, I propose an Open Vote Verification Method
    (OVVM) for a DRE e-voting system that allows independent Verification
    Modules (VM) made by different firms to interoperate with the DRE voting
    machine. The OVVM helps sharing the entire trust among multiple vendors
    that produce the system components. Furthermore, I propose an example
    implementation to demonstrate the approach and to hint how a better
    balance can be achieved between the verifiability and privacy. Finally, I
    evaluate the OVVM approach based on a prototype implementation. The output
    of the final step is a set of requirements at which an OVVM system could
    be able to mitigate most of the known challenges of the DRE system.

  title: Persuasive Technology in Diet Management
  period: 2015-2018
  abstract: >-
    Various health risks are related to unhealthy lifestyles and poor
    dietary habits. A number of pathologies due to these health risk
    behaviors represent a serious challenge, resulting in disabling or
    life-threatening repercussions. People struggle to adhere to
    dietary requirements, exercise, and lifestyle
    recommendations. Additionally, decreased motivation results in a
    probability of negative health implications.

    This study evaluates existing technologies used to have users
    adhere to sustained healthy behavior. We investigate persuasive
    technology and gamification strategies to reinforce users in
    exercising and healthy food substitution. We intend to develop a
    model to be used in creating-producing widgets to persuade people
    change their lifestyle. Subsequently, our model facilitates a
    sustained diet management plan supported by healthcare experts to
    intervene in the activity, only when necessary.

  title: Effective Analysis, Characterization, and Detection of Malicious Activities on the Web
  period: 2011-2013
  abstract: >-
    Cyber-criminals use the Web as a medium to perform malicious
    activities motivated by illegitimate benefits. Victims are often
    lured to visit malicious web pages and end up loosing their
    invaluable credentials or they get their systems compromised by
    malware that uses victims’ devices to mount future attacks. While
    the state-of-art to thwart web-borne malware is promising, it is
    yet limited in addressing the following three challenges. First,
    existing techniques are limited to partial characterization of
    attack payloads. Secondly, attacker-motivated and benign evolution
    of web page artifacts have challenged the resilience of existing
    detection techniques. Thirdly, exploit kits have become
    increasingly prevalent as the major means to spread web-borne
    malware.

    This dissertation presents approaches and tools to address these
    challenges. To address partial characterization of attack payloads, we
    propose a holistic and lightweight approach that combines static analysis
    and minimalistic emulation to analyze and detect malicious web
    pages. Evaluation of the approach on a large corpus of web pages shows
    that the approach not only is precise enough in detecting malicious web
    pages with very low false signals but also does detection with a minimal
    performance penalty. To address evolution of web page artifacts, we
    propose an evolution-aware approach that tunes detection models inline
    with evolution of web page artifacts. Evaluation of our approach suggests
    that it reduces false negatives by about 10% on a fairly large test corpus
    of web pages. To tackle prevalence of exploit kits, we develop an approach
    that leverages attack-centric and self-defense behaviors of exploit kits
    to detect malicious URLs. The evaluation of our classifiers shows that our
    approach is effective in precisely detecting malicious URLs linked with
    exploit kits and it incurs very low false positives.

  title: "Standardizing ICT for Development: Towards the Definition of a Standard Process and Maturity Model for ICTD Projects"
  period: 2010-2012
  abstract: >-
    The use of ICTs to stimulate socio-economic development has significantly
    grown in popularity in the recent years and has been boosted by the
    “mobile revolution” of the last decade. Despite the multi-year experience
    of academics, donor agencies and businesses, the failure rate of ICT for
    Development projects is still very high, resulting in a significant waste
    of resources. The multiple challenges that must be faced simultaneously in
    these projects make them more difficult than “traditional” ICT projects
    and recommendations such as best practices to face them have been
    suggested over the years. Nonetheless, the systematic replicability of
    these practices has never been addressed and project management and
    formalized development processes that address the particular challenges of
    the domain are extremely rare. This thesis presents a Maturity Model
    derived from the experience of researchers and practitioners, collected
    through an extensive literature review and interviews, that aims at
    providing a set of guidelines to be used throughout an ICT for Development
    intervention to increase the probability of success.

  title: Using Formal Methods for Building More Reliable and Secure e-voting Systems
  period: 2010-2012
  abstract: >-
    Deploying a system in a safe and secure manner requires ensuring the
    technical and procedural levels of assurance also with respect to social
    and regulatory frameworks. This is because threats and attacks may not
    only derive from pitfalls in complex security critical system, but also
    from ill-designed procedures. However, existing methodologies are not
    mature enough to embrace procedural implications and the need for
    multidisciplinary approach on the safe and secure operation of
    system. This is particularly common in electronic voting (e-voting)
    systems. This dissertation focuses along two lines. First, we propose an
    approach to guarantee a reasonable security to the overall systems by
    performing for- mal procedural security analysis. We apply existing
    techniques and define novel methodologies and approaches for the analysis
    and verification of procedural rich systems. This includes not only the
    definition of adequate modeling convention, but also the definition of
    general techniques for the injection of attacks, and for the
    transformation of process models into representations that can be given as
    input to model checkers. With this it is possible to understand and
    highlight how the switch to the new technological solution changes
    security, with the ultimate goal of defining the procedures regulating
    system and system processes that ensure a sufficient level of security for
    the system as well as for its procedures. We then investigate the usage of
    formal methods to study and analyze the strength and weaknesses of
    currently deployed (e-voting) system in order to build the next generation
    (e-voting) systems. More specifically, we show how formal verification
    techniques can be used to model and reason about the security of an
    existing e-voting system. To do that, we reuse the methodology propose for
    procedural security analysis. The practical applicability of the
    approaches is demonstrated in several case studies from the domain of
    public administrations in general and in e-voting system in
    particular. With this it can be possible to build more secu§re, reliable,
    and trustworthy e-voting system.
